## The ride

Our attempt to ride to Cold Spring was cut short, but still a beautiful ride. Ride up the west side of Manhattan, take the George Washington bridge into New Jersey, bike up the Palisades, past Nyack, all along the 9W. It's a shared path with cars, but tons of bikers along the road so decently safe. Pack lots of food and water (and salt) with you, since there aren't that many food stops along this path. Elevation 2,000+ ft... get ready for them hills.

Pro tip: It's *probably* a good idea to heed heat warnings issued by the city, and do NOT try to be a hero and bike in the smoldering heat. But, in case you're one of the crazy ones, here's a good car service to call if you need to abort mission and hitch a ride back into the city: <a href="http://www.superclasscarservice.com" target="_blank">Super Class Car Service</a> 845-241-5555.

## Food stops

1. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/absolute-bagels-new-york" target="_blank">Absolute Bagels</a> is literally the best bagel you'll get in NYC. I know that's a big statement. Just go there and see for yourself, and when you do, tell me what you think. This is what I call this the "Sophy Special"... everything bagel with strawberry cream cheese (also good with blueberry). A little savory, a little sweet, best of both worlds.

2. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-9w-market-palisades" target="_blank">The 9W Market</a> is super charming. Lots of bikers come here for the food, beer, coffee, pastries, and of course, pizza:
