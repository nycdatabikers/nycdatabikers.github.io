# Highlights: Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pie, Tacoways, Beer



## The ride

This is the scenic route, hugging the coast line all the way to Rockaways. A little bit longer, but worth it for the extra sites. From the city, take the Manhattan bridge into Brooklyn, bike through Red Hook.

Stop by the newly created <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bush-terminal-park-sunset-park" target="_blank">Bush Terminal Park</a>, incredibly under utilized at the moment but a great view:

Then hug the coast line, past Coney Island, and into the Rockaways. For a more direct route back, take Flatbush Ave to cut straight into Brooklyn.
