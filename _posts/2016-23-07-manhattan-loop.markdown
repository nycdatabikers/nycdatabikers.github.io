Bike up the Greenway along the Hudson (all protected bike lane), take a detour to the<a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=president+grand+tomb&find_loc=new+york&ns=1" target="_blank">General Grant Memorial</a> and see where President Grant is entombed above ground. July 23 is the anniversary of President Grant's death, so if you're lucky like us, you'll catch a reenactment:

Stop by the iconic <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-little-red-lighthouse-new-york" traget="_blank">Little Red Lighthouse</a> that inspired this <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18860.The_Little_Red_Lighthouse_and_the_Great_Gray_Bridge" traget="_blank">children's book:

## Food stops

1. Head to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/malecon-restaurant-new-york-2" target="_blank">Malecon</a> in Washington Heights for Dominican Food. Their famous roasted chicken is only $12 for a whole chicken:

2. We ate too much at Malecon, so couldn't make it to pizza. But once you hit battery park, stop by <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-new-york-11?osq=shake+shack" traget="_blank">Shake Shack</a> for your version of ice cream/shake/cones:
