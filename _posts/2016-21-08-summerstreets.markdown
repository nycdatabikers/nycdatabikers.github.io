## The ride

Started out at the north edge of Central Park and biked our way downtown. Summer Streets is a series of weekends when the city closes down certain avenues to cars. Honestly one of the best experience you'll have exploring the architecture of this city is biking through Grand Central Tunnel. ![Grand Central](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/summerstreets1.jpg)

After Summer Streets, we headed to Dumbo and tried the famous Juliana's (same owner as the kind-of-overrated Grimaldi's) and to South Brooklyn in an attempt to eat some delicious Georgian cheesy bread from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/ton%C3%A9-caf%C3%A9-georgian-bread-brooklyn" target="_blank">Tone Cafe</a>. Very sadly, the place caught on fire the night before. We're very happy to see it's up and running again! Will have to check it out another time.

We also had a special invitation to taste <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dondon.ny" target="_blank">Don Don NYC</a> right before it opened for the summer! Biked to their test kitchen to get a first taste. 

## Food stops

1. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5" target="_blank">Juliana's Pizza</a> is far better than its more famous sister pizzeria, Grimaldi's. I don't usually like pizzas without tomato sauce, but the No. 2 pizza with cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozarella, garlic and sea salt, sealed the deal for me.

2. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-ice-cream-factory-brooklyn-3" target="_blank">Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory</a> because how can you not smile seeing this:

3. <a href="http://www.routeandgo.net/place/3384509/united-states/bayan-ko-sari-sari-store" target="_blank">Bayan Ko Sari-Sari Store</a> for Filipino snacks, which made up for missing cheesy bread. Classics include shrimp chips, fried peanut snacks, juice, and of course dried mangoes: ![Bayan Ko Sari-Sari Store](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/summerstreets4.jpg)

4. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dondon.ny" target="_blank">Don Don NYC</a> for Japanese curry, which is a comfort food staple in many Asian households. Don Don NYC takes a classic and makes it modern yet still familiar and nostalgic at the same time. Kudos to the genius May Matsuo Rose for bringing this into our lives - we're big fans of May! ![Don Don NYC](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/summerstreets5.jpg)
If you live in NYC, this Saturday October 29, 2016 is the LAST DAY to try Don Don NYC before they close for the season. Head to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/222771974805961" target="_blank">Hester Street Fair</a> between 11:00am-6:00pm and check them out!
