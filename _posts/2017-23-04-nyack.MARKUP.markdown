# Highlights: Taszo, 9W Market

We usually save this ride for later in the season, when our legs are a bit stronger but the weather in April is actually perfect for this kind of ride.

2. <a href="https://www.the9wmarket.com/" target="_blank">9W Market</a> This spot is loittered with bikers at all times of the day. Their breakfast sandwiches are the perfect mix of carbs and protein to get you through the rolling hills:
