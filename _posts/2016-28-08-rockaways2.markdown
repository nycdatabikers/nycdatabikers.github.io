## The ride

Went for a more direct route, headed down Eastern Parkway through Brooklyn into Howard Beach for pizza, then crossed the Cross Bay Blvd bridge into Rockaways, where we flew a kite! Literally went to 3 stores on our last Rockaways trip to find a kite, and then it rained on us right when we got to the beach! So happy to finally accomplish this mission on Rockaways 2.0:

## Food stops

1. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-park-pizzeria-howard-beach" target="_blank">New Park Pizzeria</a> for some classic brick oven pizza. I liked the grandma style slices slightly better than the classic margherita, but both great!

2. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/caracas-arepa-bar-rockaway-park-3" target="_blank">Caracas Arepa Bar</a> for, obviously, the arepas. I love that they have a vegetarian option (pictured - that's soy meat) and also must get the yuca fries:
