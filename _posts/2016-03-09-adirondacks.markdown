# Highlights: Sugar House Creamery, Smoke Signal, Lake Placid, Kayaking, Downtown Diner, The Good Bite, Wyatt's, The ADK Cafe, K&D Deli

This was a 3 day trip in total - the perfect trip to be in nature and see some historic Olympic sites. We had a friend drive and drop us off at Wesport, where we stayed a night. The next morning, we biked from Wesport, through Upper Jay, into Lake Placid and spent 2 days there, so we could have one day to kayak around Mirror Lake and Lake Placid. On our last day, we zipped back to Wesport to catch up with our friend. Lucky for us, we got there a little early, and killed time biking down to explore Lake Champlain (you're really close to the water already).

## The ride day 1

Overall, the elevation on day 1 of biking is much greater (3,743 ft) but there is a KILLER hill on the way back to Wesport, where you gain 655ft in 2 miles. It doesn't matter though, beautiful, unforgettable scenary all the way.

## Food stops

1. <a href="http://www.sugarhousecreamery.com" target="_blank">Sugar House Creamery</a> is super charming. They have their own cows, make delicious cheese, and pastries. I still can't stop thinking about this carmelized onion savory scone:

2. They also get fresh bread deliveries everyday from <a href="http://www.theclayhearth.com/frozen-pizza-and-bread-drop-offs/" target="_blank">The Clay Hearth</a>. You can tell so much love goes into these loaves - this one fed us for days:

3. Once in Lake Placid, you can get BBQ at <a href="http://www.smokesignalsq.com/" target="_blank">Smoke Signals</a> (or if you're like us, just go for the beers + fries): ![Smoke Signals](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/adirondacks5.jpg)

4. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48023-d399400-Reviews-Downtown_Diner-Lake_Placid_New_York.html" target="_blank">Downtown Diner</a> for that quirky smalltown charm, where Christmas mugs are good year round: ![Downtown Diner](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/adirondacks6.jpg)

6. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/wyatts-lake-placid" target="_blank">Wyatt's</a> for surprisingly good TexMex food (I say surprisingly because I'm from Southern California and we are obnoxiously picky about Mexican food). Their hot sauce selection is out of this world: ![Wyatt's](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/adirondacks8.jpg)

7. On your way back to Westport, check out <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-adk-cafe-keene" target="_blank">The ADK Cafe</a> if you need a caffeine fix: ![The ADK Cafe](https://nycdatabikers.github.io/assets/adirondacks9.jpg)
