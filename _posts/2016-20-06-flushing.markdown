## The ride

Coming from Manhattan, take the Queensboro bridge on 59th street to enter into Queens. Bike into Flushing, aka the Real Chinatown of NYC, to Corona, down and up Flushing Meadow Park, through Astoria, and back around to Manhattan.

## Food stops

1. Real Chinese food in <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-shopping-mall-flushing-2" target="_blank">Flushing's Golden Shopping Mall</a>: We ate some delicious and surprisingly filling fish dumplings in the basement (located right next to the original Xi'An Famous Foods). Not photographed, because we were too hungry and scarfed it down.

2. Cross over to the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-world-mall-food-court-flushing" target="_blank">New World Mall</a> and get some Portuguese style egg tarts:

I'd suggest eating one more savory dish from the food court, because the rest of the ride is about to get real sweet.

3. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/max-and-minas-flushing" target="_blank">Max & Mina's</a> is nostalgia in a cup. The decor is every nineties kid's dream, and they have insane flavors that are fun to look at and eat:

4. For another kind of cold, refreshing dessert... <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-lemon-ice-king-of-corona-corona-2" target="_blank">The Lemon Ice King of Corona</a>:

5. Now that you're all sugared out, head to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/rizzos-fine-pizza-astoria" target="_blank">Rizzo's Pizzera</a> in Astoria for some grandma style pizza. You must try the grandma style margherita slice:
